# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## React documentation for WebStorm

Make sure you have [React with WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/react.html) on your computer:


## Before you start

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer:


## Create a Firebase console for the app

The following command will install all the Firebase tools [Firebase Instaflam-app](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/instaflam-app/overview) on your computer:

### `npm install -g firebase-tools` (1st step)

## Firebase (https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/instaflam-app/overview)

You can deploy now or later. To deploy now open a terminal window, then navigate to or create a root directory for your web app:

### `firebase login`

Initiate your project. Run this command from your app' root directory:

### `firebase init`

When you're ready, deploy your web app. Put your static files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc) in your app's deploy directory (the default is public). Then run this command from your app's root directory:

### `firebase deploy`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` (2nd step)

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
